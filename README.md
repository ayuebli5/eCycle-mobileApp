# eCycle-mobileApp
A mobile application built to tackle recyling e-waste challenge.


The mobile app, called "eCycle" was developed by two students as their senior project. The app aims to tackle the challenges faced when recycling e-waste, such as a lack of information about proper disposal methods and limited access to recycling facilities.

The app provides users with information about e-waste recycling, including which materials can be recycled and where to recycle them. It also includes a feature that allows users to dispose their e-waste from the comfort of their home after they provide their location in the app.

The app motivates users to recycle thier goods by giving them points for every item they recycled. The students are working to make the points redeemable by popular e-commerce and grocery industries. 

In addition, the app also has features where users can donate and send their faulty devices to repair shops.
